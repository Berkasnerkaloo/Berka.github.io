       <div class="post-content">
         <p>I'm 31, Male, and Married.</p>
         <p>I have always been interested in computers. Life didn't work out that way. I'm trying my best to have a career in something I enjoy</p>
         <p>I came across many videos and apps to teach me along the way. Mimo is by far the best app to use to get you started.</p>

         <div class="post-content">
          <p>Ran out of material to study on <strong>Mimo</strong>. It was definitely a great start but to further my skills I need to move on. Started the free Coursera class of <em>HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers</em>. Going to check it out and will update when I learn some new things. One thing I am interested in next is creating user accounts protected by password with the ability to post comments. I do not think this class will cover it. If you by chance see this website and want to point me in the right direction, Please use the contact link and shoot me an email. Thanks

         <h3 class="post-title">Courera is the way to go from here</h3>
         <div class="post-content">
          <p>Very informative. Learning a lot from the free course. Trying to get as many certificates as I can but also have a child on the way. Determining if I need to pay or not to get more on a resume when the time comes. I did just get my 100 ton license for operating tugs in the mail so I will have to put this on the backburner for a bit soon so I can upgrade to 200 ton. It's definitely not what I want to do but it is guaranteed increase in money and does have a career. More of a backup plan at the moment or something that will provide more for my family.

         <div class="post-content">
          <p>Been working on the Coursera course. My main goal was to switch careers in 1 years time. I'm on track. Currently 3 months in and learned more in that time than 4 years of just simple thing fixing issues I have. CMD is more powerful than I thought. Unconnected to the course I've been able to use a .bat file to backup my Fl studio folder to my nas drive so everything is always updated when I switch to my laptop. I go on the boat tomorrow and my internet is limited but I do have service 90% of the time. Depending where I'm at on my connection speed.
